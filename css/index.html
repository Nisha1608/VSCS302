    <div><p>A garden is never finishedâ€”it is a creation that evolves from season-to-season and year-to-year. Experienced gardeners are well aware of this reality and have even come to enjoy the ephemeral nature of their outdoor spaces. If a plant outgrows its previous home, or performs less than adequately, they enjoy selecting its replacement. When the seasons change, they enjoy seeing different plants take center stage and when drought or other climatic conditions strike, they enjoy meeting the challenge.</p>
